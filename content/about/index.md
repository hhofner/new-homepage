# About Me

My name is **Hans Hofner**, I am a web developer based in Japan. I have experience working with start ups as well as with 
large organizations that regularly deploying features for millions of users in Japan. My main tools I put to use are VueJS 
(via Vite or Nuxt 3), Phoenix Web Framework, or NestJS. I can work with any cloud provider, but my main knowledge lies in
AWS services. 

As a developer, I value clear communication, respect & humility, and continuous development. These values allow for
a healthy environment which in turn ensures teams produce high quality software at a fast pace.

For my hobbies, I enjoy playing chess, classical guitar and exercising.
